# Examples of usage

## 1. Prepare raw message for send and receive
### GoTo: [full test](https://github.com/decentralized-identity/didcomm-rs/blob/master/tests/send_receive.rs#L12)

```rust
    // Message construction
    let m = Message::new()
        // setting `from` header (sender) - Optional
        .from("did:xyz:ulapcuhsatnpuhza930hpu34n_")
        // setting `to` header (recepients) - Optional
        .to(&["did::xyz:34r3cu403hnth03r49g03", "did:xyz:30489jnutnjqhiu0uh540u8hunoe"])
        // populating body with some data - `Vec<bytes>`
        .set_body(some_payload.as_bytes());

    // Serialize message into JWM json (SENDER action)
    let ready_to_send = m.as_raw_json().unwrap();

    //... transport is happening here ...

    // On receival deserialize from json into Message (RECEIVER action)
    // Error handling recommended here
    let received = Message::receive(&ready_to_send, None).unwrap();
```

## 2. Prepare JWE message for direct send
### GoTo: [full test](https://github.com/decentralized-identity/didcomm-rs/blob/master/tests/send_receive.rs#L35)

```rust
    // decide which [Algorithm](crypto::encryptor::CryptoAlgorithm) is used (based on key)
    let alg = CryptoAlgorithm::XC20P;
    // key as bytes
    let ek = [130, 110, 93, 113, 105, 127, 4, 210, 65, 234, 112, 90, 150, 120, 189, 252, 212, 165, 30, 209, 194, 213, 81, 38, 250, 187, 216, 14, 246, 250, 166, 92]
    // creating message
    let mut message = Message::new()
    // packing in some payload (can be anything really)
        .set_body(br#"{'key':'value','key2':'value2'}"#)
    // set JOSE header for XC20P algorithm
        .as_jwe(alg)
    // add some custom app/protocol related headers to didcomm header portion
    // these are not included into JOSE header
        .add_header_field("my_custom_key".into(), "my_custom_value".into())
        .add_header_field("another_key".into(), "another_value".into());
    // set `kid` property
    message.jwm_header.kid = 
        Some(String::from(r#"Ef1sFuyOozYm3CEY4iCdwqxiSyXZ5Br-eUDdQXk6jaQ"#));
    // encrypt and serialize message with JOSE header included
    let ready_to_send = message.seal(ek.as_bytes())?;
    // use transport of choice to send `ready_to_send` data to the receiver!

    //... transport is happening here ...

```

## 3. Prepare JWS message -> send -> receive
* Here `Message` is signed but not encrypted.
* In such scenarios explicit use of `.sign(...)` and `Message::verify(...)` required.

```rust
    // Message construction an JWS wrapping
    let message = Message::new() // creating message
        .from("did:xyz:ulapcuhsatnpuhza930hpu34n_") // setting from
        .to(&["did::xyz:34r3cu403hnth03r49g03", "did:xyz:30489jnutnjqhiu0uh540u8hunoe"]) // setting to
        .set_body(sample_dids::TEST_DID_SIGN_1.as_bytes()) // packing in some payload
        .as_jws(&SignatureAlgorithm::EdDsa)
        .sign(SignatureAlgorithm::EdDsa.signer(), &sign_keypair.to_bytes()).unwrap();

    //... transport is happening here ...

    // Receiving JWS
    let received = Message::verify(&message.unwrap().as_bytes(), &sign_keypair.public.to_bytes());
```

## 4. Prepare JWE message to be mediated -> mediate -> receive
* Message should be encrypted by destination key first in `.routed_by()` method call using key for the recepient.
* Next it should be encrypted by mediator key in `.seal()` method call - this can be done multiple times - once for each mediator in chain but should be strictly sequentual to match mediators sequence in the chain.
* Method call `.seal()` **MUST** be preceeded by  `.as_jwe(CryptoAlgorithm)` as mediators may use different algorithms and key types than destination and this is not automatically predicted or populated.
* Keys used for encryption should be used in reverse order - final destination - last mediator - second to last mediator - etc. Onion style.

### GoTo: [full test](https://github.com/decentralized-identity/didcomm-rs/blob/master/tests/send_receive.rs#L67)

```rust
    // Message construction
    let message = Message::new()
        // setting from
        .from("did:xyz:ulapcuhsatnpuhza930hpu34n_")
        // setting to
        .to(&["did:xyz:34r3cu403hnth03r49g03", "did:xyz:30489jnutnjqhiu0uh540u8hunoe"])
        // packing in some payload
        .set_body(some_payload.as_bytes())
        // set JOSE header for XC20P algorithm
        .as_jwe(CryptoAlgorithm::XC20P)
        // custom header
        .add_header_field("my_custom_key".into(), "my_custom_value".into())
        // another coustom header
        .add_header_field("another_key".into(), "another_value".into())
        // set kid header
        .kid(String::from(r#"Ef1sFuyOozYm3CEY4iCdwqxiSyXZ5Br-eUDdQXk6jaQ"#))
        // here we use destination key to bob and `to` header of mediator - 
        //**THISH MUST BE LAST IN THE CHAIN** - after this call you'll get new instance of envelope `Message` destined to the mediator.
        // `ek_to_bob` - destination targeted encryption key
        .routed_by(ek_to_bob.as_bytes(), vec!("did:mediator:suetcpl23pt23rp2teu995t98u"));

    // Message envelope to mediator
    let ready_to_send = message
        .unwrap() // **ERROR HANDLE** here is recommended
        .as_jwe(CryptoAlgorithm::XC20P) // here this method call is crucial as mediator and end receiver may use different algorithms.
        // `ek_to_mediator` - mediator targeted encryption key
        .seal(ek_to_mediator.as_bytes()); // this would've failed without previous method call.

    //... transport to mediator is happening here ...

    // Received by mediator
    // `rk_mediator` - key to decrypt mediated message
    let received_mediated = Message::receive(&ready_to_send.unwrap(), Some(rk_mediator.as_bytes()));

    //... transport to destination is happening here ...

    // Received by Bob
    // `rk_bob` - key to decrypt final message
    let received_bob = Message::receive(&String::from_utf8_lossy(&received_mediated.unwrap().get_body()?.as_ref()), Some(rk_bob.as_bytes()));
```

## 5. Prepare JWS envelope wrapped into JWE -> sign -> pack -> receive
* JWS header is set automatically based on signing algorythm type.
* Message forming and encryption happens in same way as in other JWE examples.
* ED25519-dalek signature is used in this example with keypair for signing and public key for verification.

### GoTo: [full test](https://github.com/decentralized-identity/didcomm-rs/blob/master/tests/send_receive.rs#L119)

```rust
    // Message construction
    let message = Message::new() // creating message
        .from("did:xyz:ulapcuhsatnpuhza930hpu34n_") // setting from
        .to(&["did::xyz:34r3cu403hnth03r49g03"]) // setting to
        .set_body(sample_dids::TEST_DID_SIGN_1.as_bytes()) // packing in some payload
        .as_jwe(CryptoAlgorithm::XC20P) // set JOSE header for XC20P algorithm
        .add_header_field("my_custom_key".into(), "my_custom_value".into()) // custom header
        .add_header_field("another_key".into(), "another_value".into()) // another coustom header
        .kid(String::from(r#"Ef1sFuyOozYm3CEY4iCdwqxiSyXZ5Br-eUDdQXk6jaQ"#)); // set kid header

    // Send as signed and encrypted JWS wrapped into JWE
    let ready_to_send = message.seal_signed(
        encryption_key.as_bytes(),
        &sign_keypair.to_bytes(),
        SignatureAlgorithm::EdDsa)
        .unwrap();

    //... transport to destination is happening here ...

    //Receive - same method to receive for JWE or JWS wrapped into JWE but with pub verifying key
    let received = Message::receive(
        &ready_to_send,
        Some(decryption_key.as_bytes()),
        Some(&pub_sign_verify_key.to_bytes())); // and now we parse received
```
## 6. Multiple receivers static key wrap per recepient with shared secret
* ! Works with `resolve` feature only - requires resolution of public keys for each recepient for shared secret generation.
* Static key generated randomly in the background (`to` field has >1 recepient).

### GoTo: [full test](https://github.com/decentralized-identity/didcomm-rs/blob/master/src/messages/message.rs#L597)
```rust
// Creating message with multiple recepients.
let m = Message::new()
    .from("did:key:z6MkiTBz1ymuepAQ4HEHYSF1H8quG5GLVVQR3djdX3mDooWp")
    .to(&["did:key:z6MkjchhfUsD6mmvni8mCdXHw216Xrm9bQe2mBH1P5RDjVJG", "did:key:z6MknGc3ocHs3zdPiJbnaaqDi58NGb4pk1Sp9WxWufuXSdxf"])
    .as_jwe(&CryptoAlgorithm::XC20P);

let jwe = m.seal(&sender_private);
// Packing was ok?
assert!(jwe.is_ok());

let jwe = jwe.unwrap();

// Each of the recepients receive it in same way as before (direct with single receiver)
let received_first = Message::receive(&jwe, &first_private);
let received_second = Message::receive(&jwe, &second_private);

// All good without any extra inputs
assert!(received_first.is_ok());
assert!(received_second.is_ok());
```

# Plugable cryptography

In order to use your own implementation[s] of message crypto and/or signature algorythms implement these trait[s]:

[`didcomm_rs::crypto::Cypher`](https://github.com/decentralized-identity/didcomm-rs/blob/master/src/crypto/mod.rs#L30)

[`didcomm_rs::crypto::Signer`](https://github.com/decentralized-identity/didcomm-rs/blob/master/src/crypto/mod.rs#L39)

Dont use `default` feature - might change in future.

When implemented - use them instead of `CrptoAlgorithm` and `SignatureAlgorithm` from examples above.

# Strongly typed Message payload (body)

### GoTo: [full test](https://github.com/decentralized-identity/didcomm-rs/blob/main/tests/shape.rs)

In most cases apllication implementation would prefer to have strongly typed body of the message instead of raw `Vec<u8>`.
For this scenario `Shape` trait should be implemented for target type.

* First, let's define our target type. JSON in this example.
```rust
#[derive(Serialize, Deserialize, PartialEq, Debug)]
struct DesiredShape {
    num_field: usize,
    string_field: String,
}
```

* Next, implement `Shape` trait for it
```rust
impl Shape for DesiredShape {
    type Err = Error;
    fn shape(m: &Message) -> Result<DesiredShape, Error> {
        serde_json::from_slice(&m.body)
            .map_err(|e| Error::SerdeError(e))
    }
}
```

* Now we can call `shape()` on our `Message` and shape in in.
* In this example we expect JSON payload and use it's Deserializer to get our data, but your implementation can work with any serialization.
```rust
let received_typed_body = DesiredShape::shape(&m).unwrap(); // Where m = Message
```

# Building wrappers for multiple languages

The *didcomm_rs* library has been created in Rust and is available for use in Rust applications.  Using the Foreign Function Interface (FFI) functionality, *didcomm_rs* can also be included in other languages that are capable of including libraries and making C language calls.  The main drawback of FFI is that it uses C-language method calling and memory management techniques.  Since mixing architectural models can introduce errors and imposes a new architecture on native language developers, it is often an unwanted level of complexity.  

In order to simplify including Rust libraries in non-Rust applications, [Mozilla](https://www.mozilla.org) launched the [Uniffi](https://github.com/mozilla/uniffi-rs) project, which is used to automatically generate language wrappers that interface with Rust libraries.  Since these language wrappers are automatically generated, the FFI methods they employ are abstracted from developers who are presented with actual native language interfaces to Rust libraries.  Currently, Mozilla's Uniffi automatically generates language wrappers for Swift, Python, Kotlin, and C/C++.

The Uniffi processes have been added to *didcomm_rs* in order to provide additional language wrappers without the development costs of creating them.  For a detailed tutorial on how to create Uniffi-based language wrappers for Rust libraries, please see the [FFI Tutorials](https://github.com/sudoplatform-labs/ffi-tutorials) created by [Anonyome Labs](https://anonyome.com), which provide detailed steps and descriptions.

In order to compile *didcomm_rs*, the following high level steps are provided:

1. Install the [Uniffi development tools](https://github.com/mozilla/uniffi-rs)
2. Change directory to the didcomm_rs root directory
3. Build the scaffolding layer via the command line by executing
	* *uniffi-bindgen scaffolding ./src/didcomm-rs.uniffi.udl*
4. Build the language wrapper via the command line (for Swift) by executing
	* *uniffi-bindgen generate ./src/didcomm-rs.uniffi.udl --language swift*
	* Note:  substituting *kotlin* or *python* for *swift* in the above command will generate wrappers for those languages
5.  Build the *didcomm_rs* library by executing
	* *cargo build*
6. Run the sample Swift test application contained in the root directory
